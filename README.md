# DemoNothing
Demo of functionally nothing, but technically something 

Basically just a bunch of ASP.NET's stuffs stuffed inside this project that does functionally... nothing.

And yes, I am aware some of the functionality only make sense when application is deployed at scale.

Features that I'm adding here:
- Auth using OAuth, token server is using Keycloak
- Caching mechanism using Redis
- Logging using Serilog
- OpenTelemetry-compliant tracing
- Health check
- Message broker client to RabbitMQ
